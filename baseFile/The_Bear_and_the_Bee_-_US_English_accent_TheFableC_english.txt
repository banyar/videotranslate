The Bear and the Bee
A version of the tale by TheFableCottage.com
Everybody knows that bears love honey.
One day, Mr. Bear looks in his cupboard, and he can't find any honey.
Oh no, no honey, he says.
So he goes into the forest to find some.
He sees a beehive in a tree.
He smells the honey.
Mmm, honey!
He sticks his paw into the beehive and...
A bee flies out.
Hey bear, go away, says the bee.
This is not your honey.
Mr. Bear is annoyed.
I am bigger than you, he says.
And I am stronger than you, too.
I can do what I want.
Now buzz off!
Mr. Bear sticks his paw into the beehive again, and...
Zzzz!
Zoing!
Owie!
The bee stings him right on his nose
My nose, my nose, ooh, I'm so angry
Growls Mr. Bear
He finds a big stick
He tries to hit the bee
He swings and he swings
But the bee is too fast
Mr. Bear gets angrier and angrier
I will squash you, come here
The bee flies back into the beehive
Aha, now you're trapped
Yells Mr. Bear
He swings his stick at the beehive
Smash, smash, smash
He smashes it to pieces
Then he hears a strange sound
It gets louder and louder
Thousands of bees fly out of the smashed beehive
They fly around Mr. Bear's head
They sting him on his ear
They sting him on his elbow
They chase Mr. Bear through the forest
They sting him on his arms
His legs, his hands
And especially on his nose
Mr. Bear runs all the way home
And slams the door shut
Bam!
Then he hears a voice behind him
It's Mrs. Bear
You did it again, didn't you?
She says
You lost your temper
Yes
He says as he cries and counts his bee stings
Here's the bee sting medicine
Says Mrs. Bear
Also, we have honey in the cupboard
It's behind the flower
Moral
A hot temper always gets you into trouble
If you look at the cat
MEETFUL

Have it
I love you
I love you
You
Goodbye
I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
Bye
